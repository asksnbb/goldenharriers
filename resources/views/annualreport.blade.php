                    <p><b>Annual Report 2021-22</b></p>
                    <b>A heart filled with aspirations is all that we knew since the very existence of the school and that's what gave us the ambition of marching forward till excellence is achieved in all our endeavours. This report is comprised of the achievements made during the year gone by and at the same time set the path for greater accomplishments in the years to come.</b> 
                    <b>Report Highlights</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a regular practice followed every year, this session began with the Orientation Programme for the parents of the students of classes Pre-Primary to XI. The programme made the parents aware of the scheme of education we impart here at our school. Query-resolving session by a child psychologist illuminated the path of positive parenting.</li>
                        <li>Chairman Sir Launched a New App for Digital Parents Communication – Neverskip App where the the parents can get all information about circulars ,Academic performance, assignment,fee Details of their ward.</li>
                        <li>Keeping ourselves up with the pace of the modern world, Complete Digitization of the school was undertaken which transformed the entire school chores channel through the Information Technology, bringing in more transparency and enhanced communication with parents and community.</li>
                        <li>Having the school completely digitized has innumerous advantages to the parents, teachers and the school itself.Parents can keep a real-time track of the status of their child for Daily Attendance, Fee status, Periodic Results, School Circulars and News, etc. through the SCHOOL APP on Android and Apple mobiles and through the WEB PORTAL. Parents have a direct access to communicate with the Class-Teacher for regular update of their child and the cases which need my personal attention can be escalated directly to me through the provision of Communicate in our Portal. Parents and teachers have been brought closer as this software provide a direct upload of the daily homework on the online portal parallel to what's given in the classroom, so that parents too are apprised of the daily homework given in classroom and the same can be enforced at the parents' end too.</li>
                        <li>As a new endeavour, we took a giant leap in the examination procedure this year by replacing the conventional regime of manually prepared Reports-cards by the teachers with Computer Generated Report-Cards. This transformation minimized the efforts of the teachers to manually fill in the Report-Cards all by themselves.</li>
                        <li>Making our students globally relevant is need of the hour and with the same idea, we introduced Japanese Language in our curriculum beginning this session for Class V onwards.</li>
                        <li>With the sole purpose of updating teachers' knowledge, the school hosted a series of Teachers' Workshops. It was an attempt which inclusively engulfed various significant aspects like Moral Values, Life Skills by CBSE, Meditation & Stress Management,AI & Robotics, English Language and Mathematics. Apart from this, our teachers are made a part of the training sessions and workshops happening at other schools. Our teachers attended various workshops like CHINTAN workshop, workshop on NURTURING EARLY CHILDHOOD and ADOLESCENCE MANAGEMENT, workshops on various ACADEMIC SUBJECTS. Attendee teachers further share the knowledge with other fellow teachers widening the sphere of wisdom.</li>
                        <li>To take part is what counts in competition and lessons of victory and defeat are what we get in return. This environment was sufficiently created through inter-school, inter-house and inter-class competitions such as debates, Vad-Vivaad Pratiyogita, Shlok Competition, Quiz, Rangoli, Declamation, Creative-Writing, Spelling-Bee, Rhyme and Rhythm, Drawing and Power-Point competitions. Our students took part in various inter-school and zonal level Competitions and brought laudable laurels to the school.</li>
                        <li>Since the last two years, we are making our students take the first taste of democracy and leadership qualities through the totally Computerized Voting System in Student Council Elections which has enabled us to remove the manual problems in counting the ballots. Elected members got their badges pinned on Investiture Ceremony where Independence Day and Van Mahotsav were also celebrated along with.</li>
                        <li>Excellent CBSE Class X result, filled us with pride and I feel honored to put forward the result of Class X here today : Out of 63 students appeared, 36 distinctions were recorded in all.

                    <p><b>We are drowning in information and severely starving for wisdom today. Fortunately, we are empowered with demographic dividend knocking on our door. We just need to break the cocoon and let in the beautiful colours of knowledge. I am sure in the coming years, we shall successfully channelize the halo of the young minds to explore best of their abilities.

                      <br><br>  Towards the end, I thank the supportive management whose continuous support to our ideology of education has enabled the school to come this far. Teachers and the entire staff members also deserve applause for their tireless efforts in implementing the route map of imparting quality education here. I also extend my heartfelt thanks to the parents of our students who have shown unflinching faith in us by giving us the profound opportunity to transform their children into truly useful citizens of the future world.
                        
                      <br><br>  With that, let us foresee a world of universal singularity where our children are going to be the propellant of this change and the world shall be a beautiful place to live in..!!!</b></p>
