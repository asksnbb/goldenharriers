                            We welcome you to Golden Harrier School, with a commitment to encourage young learners towards society by giving equal education to all.  <b>“The aim of the education is the knowledge, not of facts but of values” - William S Burroughs</b>

<br><br>According to Chinese proverb, "If you are planning for one year, grow rice; if you are planning for 10 years, plant a tree; if you are planning for 100 years, provide education to the children". Good and proper education plays a decisive role in shaping our future and professional career. It helps to develop personality and earn recognition and respect in the family and society as well. Teachers play a central role in providing good level of education.

<br><br>Golden Harrier School is a place that conceits itself on the relationship it has with its community. The School endeavors to educate students so that they are ready to reach their premier potential. We intend to excel in all that we do. Our School’s moto is "With Enlightenment We Progress", which reflects the many cultures that approach together in our School in order to enlighten the lives of the students with the vivacity of education. The passionate teachers work in partnership with parents to offer the supreme education for each student.

<br><br>The School works towards plunging the gap between home and School so that parents and teachers are in the best probable position to support the learning of the child. The School uses learning technologies that replicate the contemporary world our students live in. We at Golden Harrier teach the skills and values necessary for success in education, life and work. Success for all students is ensured by the delivery of an enriching and structured curriculum that focuses on the positive recognition of Student achievements. It is our commitment that every Harrier is provided with the educational environment needed to achieve personal excellence, inside and outside the classroom. We make students literate, numerate, well educated citizens who have the capability, confidence and independence to make a positive contribution to our society.
